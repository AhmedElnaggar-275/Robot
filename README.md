 This code is to control a simple robot of two legs which are controlled by 2*(360 degree mega servos).
 I have credits to the arduino code only.
 The python (objectDetection.py) is credited to my friend.

 This code uses state-driven control
 The code is heavily commented carefully by me to ensure solid documentaion of the idea flow
 Feel free to ask me about any confusing part or suggest modifications in arduino code via email : es-ahmed.elnagar2027@alexu.edu.eg
